Template for a TiddlyWiki5 that renders to html. With scripts for deploying to gh_pages. For use with org-pm2.  See more details in http://github.com/iani/org-pm2.

* Running the Wiki in online-editable mode with Node.js

Running the wiki locally:

On the shell, navigate (=cd=) to the folder that contains the wiki which you want to run (in this case: Try with the template folder in =./template/=). Then execute the shell command: =tiddlywiki server --server 8080=.  Full script when running from the present file: 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd ./template/
tiddlywiki server --server 8080 
#+END_EXAMPLE

This starts the wiki on port 8080. The wiki will be accessible at:

http://127.0.0.1:8080

Note: Each new wiki must be started on a different port number. Change the port number at will.
